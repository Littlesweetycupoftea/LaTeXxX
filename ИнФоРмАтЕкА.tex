	Oh February, to get ink and weep!
	And write about it mourning,
	While the uproaring, raging sleet,
	Like in the spring, is burning.

	Go rent a buggy. For six grivnas,
	Race through the blare of bells and wheels,
	To where the shower often drizzles
	Much louder than ink and tears.
	
	Where, like the charcoal pears, the crows
	From trees, by thousands, will rise,
	Crash into puddles, and then toss
	Dry sadness deep into your eyes.

	Below, thawed patch is showing through,
	With loud cries, the wind is grubbed.
	The more haphazard the more true 
	The poems are composed and sobbed.
